# FileCompressor
Task 7 in NTNU course algorithms and data-structures

File is run from the FileCompressor class

Since this code was made for algorithms and data-structure my focus was on completing the task and not making the code as pretty as possible

Compressor uses lempel-ziv and huffman algorithm

Used java8 in this project
